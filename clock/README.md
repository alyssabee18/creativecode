# Morse Code Clock

This is an abstract clock I made with p5.js. The you can see it running by copying this javascript file [the javascript file](MORSE-CLOCK.js)  into a [p5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org/alyssabee18/sketches/2bNOpMx_c) and run it.

The time is represented through morse code, hours and seconds are printed according to the time on the devise that is running my code, and hours are always printed above seconds. I chose a black and white theme for stylistic reasons, also, the examples of morse posters I viewed online seemed to keep a similar theme - such as this Telegraph (https://www.poster-rama.com/products/1840-morse-code-telegraph-sign-military-maritime-nautical-patent-art-poster?variant=49615173076.)


For this project, I was able to learn through Computer Science Tutoring, and references on the p5.js website (https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/textFont) as well as fonts that were reccommended for JavaScript. I selected the font "Courier New" because I felt that it represented the theme of my Morse clock well. 


This clock was inspired by the representation of time in the film Interstellar.  Two vital characters, Cooper, and his daughter Murph, are connected through time and space by two watches.  Further into Interstellar, Cooper travels into the Tesseract (https://interstellarfilm.fandom.com/wiki/Tesseract), a five dimensional structure where every moment in time can be manipulated. Cooper uses gravity within the Tesseract to send Murph a message in Morse Code - this message, reads "S.T.A.Y" - a beautiful, yet haunting word that reflects one of the deeper meanings of the film.

Time is Interstellar is something that becomes a barrier.  However, it is proven that time cannot put boundaries between human emotion, no matter its tampers with, it cannot challenge the power of love.
