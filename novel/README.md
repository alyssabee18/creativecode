# like tears in rain

This project folder contains one example for generating a novel, as definied by [NaNoGenMo](http://nanogenmo.github.io). 

For my novel, I decided to work through Python Notebook to generate nearly 400 pages of the lines "like tears in rain - a dove ascends." I used this Roy Batty quote to make a statement about the replicants in #Blade Runner, and #Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? I wrote more about this on [my blog](http://creativecoding.alyssakbrown.com/about/).

I recieved help for this project from the html presented in this [Python Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-xEMjJ-6zbzA_c8pqnQOKRVIe8Jwdwna).
