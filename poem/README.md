# HeavenSentPoem

This project is a poem generator in Python. To see it run, download the [python script](frankpoem.py) and run it with Python or in a notebook. It will require [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify), so make sure you've installed that first. 

This script also assumes you have a file called "HEAVENSENT.txt" in the same directory that the script runs from. The contents of that file can be anything you want to appropriate from. 

I worked with two friends to install and correctly run Markovify.  This program can pull random parts of the text that I have uploaded to use as output. Based on the range I have chosen and "make short sentence" line of code that I added, my program is capable of printing a poem. 

AN EXPLANATION OF THE SCRIPT I CHOSE:

“If you think because she is dead, I am weak, then you understand very little. If you were any part of killing her, and you're not afraid, then you understand nothing at all. So, for your own sake, understand this. I am the Doctor. I'm coming to find you, and I will never, ever stop.”

And he doesn’t. 

For 4.5 billion years, the Doctor is stuck inside a time loop, a hell personalized just for him through what is referred to as a “confession dial.”  Designed meticulously by Gallifreyans, the dial attempts to receive an answer in question from a complex, very dangerous Gallifreyan legend known as, “A hybrid creature, thought to be crossbred from two warrior races, (that) would stand over the ruins of Gallifrey and unravel the Web of Time, breaking a billion billion hearts to heal its own” (TARDIS Data Core). 

It is strongly implied by the end of series nine that “The Hybrid” is a combination of Clara Oswald and the Doctor -  both become reckless when death or separation is presented as an outcome that must be faced.  In Clara Oswald’s case, she has been killed an episode prior (Face the Raven).  

The Doctor uses the confession dial as an opportunity to bring Clara back from the dead.  He will do so when he comes face to face with his captors. 

Ultimately, I want this poem to reflect random revelations the Doctor has throughout the episode Heaven Sent.  Perhaps the poetry will highlight moments of pain, anger, or hope - from time to time, Clara will appear as a hallucination and convince the Doctor to push on, to prevail, and win the war.  No matter the output, I imagine the code will allow its audience to see a different aspect of Heaven Sent each time. 

Some of my favorite lines that have been generated so far:

The garden is laid out with a roaring log fire.
He goes to the side.
And the stars, they weren't in the same time zone.
That's the only way.
According to them, there's this mountain of pure diamond.
Do I have to be kept!

There's a storm on the ground far below.
The equipment in that room is yours, so work it.
I have to find you, and I run to the city.
Well, are you off to?
But I'm scared and I'm in the torture chamber.
A fly buzzes in front of the tower.

And I am falling, Clara.
And I am going to do this, Clara ...
