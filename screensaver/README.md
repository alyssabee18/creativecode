# Eclipse

My project is a "screensaver" designed for the media wall in the HCC.  My design consists of a large amount of lines that resemble rays of the sun.  I used five similar, yet separate patterns that distinguish themselves through distance.  I wanted to create a project that was able to represent an eclipse; this is done so by one a moving circle passing in front of a non-moving circle. I have also decided to use black and white as a part of my pattern. 

I was inspired by this artwork, https://open.spotify.com/track/7bSdUhYTe7SqcIDxIqAKo1 - 
And was able to use this code https://p5js.org/examples/hello-p5-animation.html
in order to make one of my circles move.  I had to change the size in order for both circles to pass evenly in front of each other, as well as the color. The commentary in the example above helped me to comment similarly in what was directly added into my project. 


For version I'm sharing here, run it by copying the javascript [https://editor.p5js.org/alyssabee18/sketches/DmSE-Stja] (eclipse.js) into a [p5.js editor](http://editor.p5js.org).
