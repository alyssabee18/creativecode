# Bot Project

This bot, [@juicero_bot](https://twitter.com/juicero_bot), was inspired by the failed Silcon Valley invention. Basically, a $400 WIFI enabled juicer was put on the market as a product that would better the process of modern day juicing. People soon realized that this product was a scam, and it recieved heavy backlash. My bot has the capability of tweeting out random, yet absurd, Juicero flavors in attempt to add onto the already existing meme. I was able to add different flavors by going through several flavor websites. Eventually, I ended with the list that I have uploaded into Cheap Bots Done Quick.  

Before I began this project, I wanted the idea of my bot to center around the Hollywood image of Artifical Intelligence. However, I was reminded of Juicero (as I am often amused by its existence) and came to the conclusion that I wanted to create a bot that could make variations of the machine's, fake, not so appetizing flavors.

The concept for my profile picture and Twitter bio came from me talking with a few friends about Skynet, which was followed by an entertaining coversation about HAL 9000 from A Space Odyssey. The header image came from an inside joke that began around the time I took an Isaac Asimov class last semester. 

The bot is hosted at [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com), so the code is a [Tracery](http://www.tracery.io/) grammar.
