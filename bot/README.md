# Juicero Bot

This bot, [@juicero_bot](https://twitter.com/juicero_bot), was inspired by the failed Silcon Valley invention. Basically, a $400 Wi-Fi enabled juicer was put on the market as a product that would better the process of modern day juicing. People soon realized that this product was a scam, and it recieved heavy backlash. My bot has the capability of tweeting out random, yet absurd, Juicero flavors in attempt to add onto the already existing meme. I was able to add different flavors by going through several flavor websites. Eventually, I ended with the list that I have uploaded into Cheap Bots Done Quick.  

Before I began this project, I wanted the idea of my bot to center around the Hollywood image of Artifical Intelligence. However, I was reminded of Juicero (as I am often amused by its existence) and came to the conclusion that I wanted to create a bot that could make variations of the machine's, fake, not so appetizing flavors.

The concept for my profile picture and Twitter bio came from me talking with a few friends about Skynet, which was followed by an entertaining coversation about HAL 9000 from A Space Odyssey. The header image came from an inside joke that began around the time I took an Isaac Asimov class last semester. 

The code allows for 253,028 unique methods of tweets to appear and can tweet up to every 6 hours.

# Mr. Krabs Bot

This bot, [@mrkrabs_bot](https://twitter.com/mrkrabs_bot), was based off of the Spongebob episode, "Krab-Borg" - Spongebob convinces Squidward that Mr. Krabs has been replaced by a robot after catching him talking to his radio in a series of beeps and boops, which starts a cycle of many humerous events. 

I used a series of beeps and boops in the code to mirror Mr. Krabs talking to his radio, also known as his "little buddy." The emojis used at the end end of every tweet convey an emotion of some kind.
